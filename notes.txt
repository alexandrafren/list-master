-Create Thunk/axios?? actions to post new todos and projects to the api and to fetch projects
-Update state when thunk updates the api with redux
-filter todos so that only non project affiliated todos are shown in the todos column
-filter todos so that only project affiliated todos are shown in the todos column
-create logic so that suggestion renders a random todo that matches user inputs
-ability to check todos off when they have been completed


how to get suggestion working:

pull all todos - Container

take user input of how much time they have and the level of stress they can handle - Input ( hold in a state)

filter all todos by time and by stress level - Container 

if none, tell user that they don't have any todos that fit those parameters and suggest they add more todos - Suggestion 

if some, show the first on the list, if they want another suggestion, show two, etc, until there is none left in the list - Suggestion
